Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Create or interface with incident response.;The SSG is prepared to respond to an event or alert and is regularly included in the incident response process  either by creating its own incident response capability or by regularly interfacing with the organization’s existing team. A standing meeting between the SSG and the incident response team keeps information flowing in both directions. Having prebuilt communication channels with critical vendors (e.g.</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Identify software defects found in operations monitoring and feed them back to engineering;Defects identified in production through operations monitoring are fed back to development and used to change engineering behavior. Useful sources of production defects include incidents  bug bounty (see [CMVM3.4])</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Track software defects found in operations through the fix process.;Defects found in operations (see [CMVM1.2]) are entered into established defect management systems and tracked through the fix process. This tracking ability could come in the form of a two-way bridge between defect finders and defect fixers or possibly through intermediaries (e.g.  the vulnerability management team)</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Have emergency response.;The organization can make quick code and configuration changes when software (e.g.  application</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Develop an operations software inventory;The organization has a map of its software deployments and related containerization  orchestration</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Fix all occurrences of software defects found in operations.;When a security defect is found in operations (see [CMVM1.2])  the organization searches for and fixes all occurrences of the defect in operations</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Enhance the SSDL to prevent software defects found in operations;Experience from operations leads to changes in the SSDL (see [SM1.1])  which can in turn be strengthened to prevent the reintroduction of defects. To make this process systematic</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Simulate software crises.;The SSG simulates high-impact software security crises to ensure that software incident detection and response capabilities minimize damage. Simulations could test for the ability to identify and mitigate specific threats or could begin with the assumption that a critical system or service is already compromised and evaluate the organization’s ability to respond. Planned chaos engineering can be effective at triggering unexpected conditions during simulations. The exercises must include attacks or other software security crises at the appropriate software layer to generate useful results (e.g.  at the application layer for web applications and at lower layers for IoT devices). When simulations model successful attacks</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Operate a bug bounty program;The organization solicits vulnerability reports from external researchers and pays a bounty for each verified and accepted vulnerability received. Payouts typically follow a sliding scale linked to multiple factors  such as vulnerability type (e.g.</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Automate verification of operational infrastructure security.;The SSG works with engineering teams to verify with automation the security properties (e.g.  adherence to agreed-upon security hardening) of infrastructure generated from controlled self-service processes. Engineers use self-service processes to create networks</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Publish risk data for deployable artifacts;The organization collects and publishes risk information about the applications  services</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Streamline incoming responsible vulnerability disclosure.;Provide external bug reporters with a line of communication to internal security experts through a low-friction  public entry point. These experts work with bug reporters to invoke any necessary organizational responses and to coordinate with external entities throughout the defect management lifecycle. Successful disclosure processes require insight from internal stakeholders</instruction>
Write one example of the company internal security rule for Software Development Department to correspond next instruction: <instruction>Do attack surface management for deployed applications.;Operations standards and procedures proactively minimize application attack surfaces by using attack intelligence and application weakness data to limit vulnerable conditions. Finding and fixing software defects in operations is important (see [CMVM1.2]) but so is finding and fixing errors in cloud security models  VPNs</instruction>
